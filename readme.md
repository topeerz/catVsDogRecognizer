Note: model has been trainged on 202 images from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/cat-dog-images-for-classification/data?select=cat_dog
_ I want to add ML which will be classifying image (initially image can be stored in resorces/hardcoded path).
_ I want to read image from URL and classify it as dog or cat.
_ What can I do to retrain model on-the-fly on device? (based on user feedack)

Arch:
_ Would be nice to have some kinde of MVX template for the project.
_ When does it make sense to create separate swift package?
